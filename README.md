This is a simple `file explorer`. It's created as recruitment task, example data is stored in `src/data.ts`.

## Getting Started

First, after cloning repo just install dependencies (you have to use newest node.js '>=18.17.0')
```bash
npm install
```

After successfully installation, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tests

To fire test just put in your terminal:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Summary / Comments

Due to time constraints related to my current position and family responsibilities, I was unable to complete all of the functionalities I had planned for the project.

Currently, the project allows for:

- Browsing folders and files
- Editing names
- Deleting
- Adding new items

These functionalities are implemented using intuitive icons and buttons, providing a user-friendly experience.

Additional features that could be considered for future development include:

- Filtering
- Real-file preview support (using node.js)

While these features would enhance the application's functionality, they were not essential for the purposes of the recruitment task. I intentionally focused on the core functionalities to demonstrate my problem-solving skills, coding style, and approach to project planning.

I am eager to discuss the application in more detail during an interview.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
